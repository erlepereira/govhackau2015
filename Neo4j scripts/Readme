Helper Scripts.

In order to import the set of data, from the xml into Neo4j, 
xml2neo[1] was used to import the set of data into cyper queries. This script bascially replicates the xml structure into the graph. The structure itself can be adapted later.

convert.sh was used along with xml2neo to convert xml files into an importable format
